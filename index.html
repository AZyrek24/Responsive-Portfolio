      <p>
        Hello, my name is Tony Lee Zyrek and I am a student at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, based in Tucson, AZ. I
        am learning to code as a full-stack web developer, and I am excited for the challenges ahead. My goals are to have
        done work in software development, front-end/back-end web, database/server management, mobile app development, video
        game development, and artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that a strong website demonstrates
        <em>ideas</em>; a place where I feel I can separate myself from others developers. I love to compose and play music,
        and I am a fan of the arts. Half of the reason that I like to golf is because I appreciate the landscape. The other
        half is continuing to improve at a life-long sport. It is with this mentality that I can continue to bring fresh
        ideas and compelling designs to an ever-growing internet.
